\defmodule {gdef}

A few macros and platform-dependent options are defined here.
These options are used by other modules to decide when 
platform-dependent functions must be commented out in the code, or not.
Most of these options are set to their true values by the program
{\it configure} in the installation process. The user may choose
to set some of them manually.
\iffalse
Each option must either be left undefined (i.e., the corresponding
macro is put to false, using ``\texttt{\#undef}) 
or can be given its proper value (using ``\texttt{\#define} commands).
An option can be defined only under certain conditions.
For example, \texttt{USE\_GMP} can be defined only if GMP
is available, \texttt{HAVE\_ERF} can be defined only if the Unix \texttt{erf}
function is available, and so on.
\fi
This module also contains functions to test near equality between numbers represented in 
\texttt{double}, and a function that prints the current host name.

  \tab Used to separate directories in the pathname of a file.

#undef USE_GMP
\endcode
  \tab  Define this macro if the GNU multi-precision package GMP
  is available.  GMP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary
  precision arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. 
	See \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp/manual}. 
%	A few random number generators in library TestU01 use arbitrary large integers, and they
%  have been implemented with GMP functions. 
	If one wants to use GMP, the GMP header file (\texttt{gmp.h}) must be in the  search path 
  of the C compiler for included files, and the GMP library must be 
  linked to create executable programs.

#undef HAVE_MATHEMATICA
\endcode
  \tab  Define this macro if the {\em Mathematica\/}
% \footnote{
%  {\em Mathematica} is a registered trademark of {\em Wolfram Research,
%   Inc.} Web address:  \texttt{www.wolfram.com}}
    software \cite{mWOL96a}
   and the {\em MathLink} program that allows a C program to call
   functions from {\em Mathematica} are available and you want to use them.
   This is used only in module \texttt{usoft} 
   of library TestU01, where the random number generators from 
   {\em Mathematica} can be called from a C program for testing with TestU01.

   When a C program uses {\em Mathematica}, it must be compiled with the
    options
   \texttt{-I\$MATHINC -L\$MATHLIB -lML}, where 
   \texttt{\$MATHINC} is the path to the header file \texttt{mathlink.h} and 
   \texttt{\$MATHLIB} is the path to the {\em MathLink\/} library \texttt{libML.a}.
   For example, in the environment of our lab, both 
   \texttt{\$MATHINC} and \texttt{\$MATHLIB} must be set to

   \url{<dir>/mathematica/5.0/linux/AddOns/MathLink/DeveloperKit/Linux/CompilerAdditions}.

  To run a main program named \texttt{tulip} on a Unix/Linux platform
  that calls {\em  Mathematica} functions, one may use
 \begin{verse} 
  \texttt{tulip -linkname 'math -mathlink' -linklaunch}.

  \tab Returns in \texttt{machine} the host name. 
  Will copy at most $n$ characters, so the array \texttt{machine[]}
  should have a size $\ge n$. This is useful, for example,
  to get the name of the machine on which a program is running.
