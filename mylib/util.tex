\defmodule {util}

This module offers macros and functions used for testing, print error messages,
allocate dynamic memory, and read/write Boolean variables.
Some of these ``functions'' are implemented as macros, for better speed.
The module also contains safe prototype functions to open and close files.
\pierre{I know that in C, function names should normally be in all lowercase,
  but the names here use some uppercase letters for historical reasons
	(many functions were adapted from Modula-2 to C in the 1990's), 
	and I think it is fine like this.
%	We may change that later with tools that change the names everywhere the functions
%	are called, but this is not a priority for now.

\guisec{Prototypes}
\code

FILE * util_Fopen (const char *name, const char *mode);
\endcode
  \tab 
  Calls {\tt fopen} (from {\tt stdio.h}) with the same arguments, but checks for errors.
  Opens or creates file with name {\tt name} in mode {\tt mode}. Returns a pointer to 
  FILE that is associated with the stream. If {\tt name} cannot be accessed, the program
  stops. 
 \endtab
\code

int util_Fclose (FILE *stream);
\endcode
  \tab 
   Calls {\tt fclose} (from {\tt stdio.h}) with the same arguments, but checks for errors.
   Closes the file associated with {\tt stream}. If the file is successfully 
   closed, {\tt 0}
   is returned. If an error occurs or the file was already closed, {\tt EOF} is returned.
 \endtab
\code

int util_GetLine (FILE *file, char *Line, char c);
\endcode
  \tab
  Reads a line of data from {\tt file}. Blank lines and comments are
  ignored. A comment is any line whose first non-whitespace character
  is {\tt c}. If the character {\tt c} appears anywhere on a line that is
  not a comment, then  {\tt c} and the rest of the line are ignored too. 
  The function returns $-1$ if end-of-file or an error is encountered,
  otherwise it returns 0.
  \endtab
\code

void util_ReadBool (char S[], lebool *x);
\endcode
  \tab
  Reads a {\tt lebool} value from string {\tt S} and returns it in  $x$.
  The possible values are  {\tt TRUE} and  {\tt FALSE}.
  \endtab
\code

void util_WriteBool (lebool x, int d);
\endcode
  \tab
  Writes the value of $x$ in a field of width $d$. If $d < 0$, 
  $x$ is left-justified, otherwise right-justified. 
  \endtab
\code

void * util_Malloc (size_t size);
\endcode
  \tab
  Calls {\tt malloc} (from {\tt stdlib.h}) with same arguments, but checks for errors.
  Allocates memory large enough to hold an object of size {\tt size}. 
	A successful call returns the base address of the allocated space, otherwise the 
  programs stops. The standard type {\tt size\_t} is defined in {\tt stdio.h}.
 \endtab
\code

void * util_Calloc (size_t dim, size_t size);
\endcode
  \tab 
  Calls {\tt calloc} (from {\tt stdlib.h}) with same arguments, but checks for errors.
  Allocates memory large enough to hold an array of {\tt dim} 
  objects each of size {\tt size}. A successful call
  returns the base address of the allocated space, otherwise the programs 
  stops. The standard type {\tt size\_t} is defined in {\tt stdio.h}.
 \endtab
\code

void * util_Realloc (void *ptr, size_t size);
\endcode
  \tab Calls {\tt realloc} (from {\tt stdlib.h}) with same arguments, but 
  checks for errors.
  Takes a pointer to a memory region previously allocated and referenced by
  {\tt ptr}, then changes its
  size to {\tt size} while preserving its content.
% The function attempts to  keep the same base address for the block, 
% but if it is not possible, it allocates a new block of  memory, 
% copying the relevant portion of the old block and deallocating it. 
  A successful call
  returns the base address of the resized (or new) space, otherwise the 
  programs stops. The standard type {\tt size\_t} is defined in {\tt stdio.h}.
 \endtab
\code

void * util_Free (void *p);
\endcode
  \tab Calls {\tt free (p)} (from {\tt stdlib.h}) to free memory 
	allocated by {\tt util\_Malloc},
   {\tt util\_Calloc} or {\tt util\_Realloc}. Always returns a {\tt NULL} pointer.
